          <p>Before you sign off your approval of the final design, please proofread carefully!! This is a very important step. Have as many eyeballs as possible read the final proof, print it out on your home printer, and make sure you have included all the correct information. Double check all names, dates, titles, addresses, phone numbers, etc. </p>

          <p><em>I will also check, double check and check again, all the details of each design to the best of my ability. That being said, even though we both will do our best, once in awhile, a small error can go unnoticed. If this is the case, we can re-print if necessary (if time allows, and additional printing charges apply).</em></p>
