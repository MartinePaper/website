            <p>Miss Hargreaves handcrafted the invitations for my wedding. I absolutely adored them and received many compliments from my guests on her work. She was a joy to work with and provided many options to choose from. We narrowed down the choices until my husband and I were completely satisfied, which didn't take very long at all! Elizabeth clearly enjoys her craft. I've worked with her on posters, merchandise, and album art as well. Her spirit and style shine through her pieces, and I've loved everything she's ever designed for me.</p>

            <p>Working with Elizabeth of Martine Paper was a genuine pleasure. I really appreciated the personal touch she brought to designing my wedding invitations. She  talked with me extensively about my vision, and really took the time to understand what I wanted. The end result was nothing short of phenomenal. Elizabeth produced one of a kind invitations that really reflected myself and my partner. We got lots of positive feedback about our invitations from friends and family, and although I may be biased, I have yet to see invitations better than ours! I know that I would not been able to get such unique, high quality invitations or such dedicated service anywhere else. Martine paper comes highly recommended! </p>
